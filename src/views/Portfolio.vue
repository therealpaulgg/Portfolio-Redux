            I've made a lot of stuff. Some things I like, some things I thought
            were impressive and now don't seem to be. So I need to revise this
            section. I'll be putting it here later.

<script lang="ts">
import { defineComponent } from "vue"
export default defineComponent({
    setup() {
        // TODO
    },
})
</script>
